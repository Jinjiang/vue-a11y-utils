Utilities for accessibility (a11y) in Vue.js

When you write a Vue app with full accessible control. You may meet some issues frequently. For example:

- Make sure the [W3C ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) roles & properties of each DOM element are set properly.
- Control the _focus_ and finish every task elegantly just by a _keyboard_.
- Using a central [live region](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions) to show messages which are generated by the app, not the user.
- Sometimes you need set a _ID reference_ or _ID reference list_ type aria attribute with _ID_ of another DOM element. But we don't use _ID_ for such a long time right?

Vue A11y Utils try to supply a group of utilities to help Vue developers finish these jobs easier.
