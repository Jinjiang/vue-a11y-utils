Utilities for accessibility (a11y) in Vue.js

When you write a Vue app with full accessible control. You may meet some issues frequently. For example:

- Make sure the [W3C ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) roles & properties of each DOM element are set properly.
- Control the _focus_ and finish every task elegantly just by a _keyboard_.
- Using a central [live region](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions) to show messages which are generated by the app, not the user.
- Sometimes you need set a _ID reference_ or _ID reference list_ type aria attribute with _ID_ of another DOM element. But we don't use _ID_ for such a long time right?

Vue A11y Utils try to supply a group of utilities to help Vue developers finish these jobs easier.

## `<VueAria>` Component

This component help you to write `role` and `aria-*` attributes better.

First you can put all `aria-*` attributes in an object. Second these a11y attributes can be inherited. Third, it's more portable.

### API

#### props

* `role`: `string`
* `aria`: `Array` or `Object`

#### slots

* default slot: the element you would put these a11y attributes in.

### Examples

``` vue
<template>
  <VueAria role="menubutton" :aria="aria">
    <button>WAI-ARIA Quick Links</button>
  </VueAria>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  components: { VueAria },
  data() {
    return {
      haspopup: true,
      controls: 'menu2'
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

which is same to:

``` vue
<template>
  <button id="menubutton" aria-haspopup="true" aria-controls="menu2">
    WAI-ARIA Quick Links
  </button>
</template>
```

So the content and structure is more clear than which with a lot of `aria-*` attribute in.
